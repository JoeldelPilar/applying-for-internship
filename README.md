# LIA 2023

## 2023-10-23 to 2023-12-29

This page was created in connection with my applying for an internship during my studies at Mediainstitutet in Stockholm.<br>
On this page I have gathered all the necessary information about myself and the skills I've acquired up to now.<br>

This is one of two "LIA" turns in the program. The program is part of what's called a "yh-program" in Sweden. <br>
A yh-program is a from of education that trains you in a specific area of traid. It's a high tempo based style of learning<br>
and inclueds two internship turns, one 10 week turn and a second 16 week turn. The program is often ca 80 weeks in total (2years). <br>

This is created for my first turn.
